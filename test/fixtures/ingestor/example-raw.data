When the complainant asked the sergeant why it was okay for the female to have broken into his car to search for his phone, the sergeant told him no crime occurred because the window of the vehicle was down.

The phone was not located and the complainant was told he could leave.

According to the complainant, on 6-30-16, at 3:38 PM, she called 911 several times from her residence because of a dispute she had with a neighbor over his repeatedly opening the fire hydrant and later threatening her.  The responding officers first spoke with the neighbor that threatened the complainant before they came to speak with her.  When the officers did speak with the complainant, she maintains the officers sided with the neighbor's version of events and refused to turn off the hydrant, despite being told by the complainant the water runoff was damaging her property and her disabled vehicle.  The complainant called 911 and requested a patrol supervisor; when the sergeant arrived, the hydrant was immediately shut off.  Eleven days later, the same two officers that responded to her residence on 6-30-16 issued her a parking ticket for parking too close to the hydrant.  The complainant states her vehicle has been parked in the same spot prior to this incident without being ticketed and the citation was issued by the officers to retaliate against her.

According to the complainant, on the morning of 9-29-16, Officer W.M. issued her vehicle a parking citation for parking in a handicapped space without displaying a placard. The complainant maintains she was not aware that a citation had been issued to her vehicle until she received a letter in the mail from the Parking Authority. The complainant states the same officer observed her daughter parking the vehicle in the same lot, followed her into the building and obtained her name from the staff. He then returned to his vehicle and queried the vehicle's tag and handicapped parking placard number and issued another parking citation to the complainant and her daughter for an amount exceeding $1,000.00. The complainant maintains that the officer had no right to follow her daughter into the building to obtain information from the staff and believes his doing so may be problematic.
